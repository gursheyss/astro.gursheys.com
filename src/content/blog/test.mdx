# Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post. It's here to provide an example of how you might structure your markdown files for your Astro blog.

Remember, the frontmatter at the top of the file is used to populate the `data` object in your Astro component. The `title`, `slug`, and `publishedDate` fields correspond to the properties you're accessing in your component.

The rest of the file is the content of your blog post. You can use markdown syntax to format this content.

```jsx {3-8}
// src/routes/blog/[slug].astro
function BlogPost({ title, publishedDate, content }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <header>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <p>{publishedDate}</p>
      </header>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```
